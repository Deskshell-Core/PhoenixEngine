# Phoenix Engine

This is a libchromiumcontent based project, which will later drive the Deskshell project, as well as acting as an alternative to CEF.
Currently, this is only a PoC. To try and compile the various components, nativate into "build" and bootstrap/build it. Then, run the program from the source root. You most likely will get some linking errors for v8Version, as you dont have all the components that I have at this point. Proper build instructions will follow. For now, just browse this as a research place. :)

You should read "Roadmap, with chromiumcontents.md" to obtain the latest concept. Please view this in raw mode, as my Markdown-fu was sleeping when I wrote this... XD
